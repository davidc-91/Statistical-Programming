# Statistical-Programming

## Packages
Firstly, different **packages** were installed into RStudio as they are required to run the code and produce output

## Datasets
Next the **data sets** are imported into RStudio. This is what I will be basing the code off

## Tibbles
**Tibbles** are dataframes and each of the datasets are now converted into tibbles

## Names
Next the tibbles are **renamed** more appropriately 

## Joins
Each of the tables are **joined** to make one bigger table which makes it easier to base my graphs off

## Barchart
This **barchart** shows a visual representation of the amount of budget the advertisers have. 

We can see that *Lever Brows* has the most amount of budget.

## Plotchart
The first of these two **plotcharts** shows the spread of the time of each click for the adverts and the second chart shows the spread of the time of each impression for the adverts

## Jitterplot 
**Jitterplot** graphs help show the overlapping points on a graph. 

The first graph shows click dates vs impression dates. The most common date for clicks and impressions was 04/11/2020 and the least common was 01/11/2020

The second graph shows the time zones of the clicks on the advertisements. The *Ninetendo* was more restricted around one time zone where as *Coca Cola* and *Lever Brows* were viewed throughout two time zones

The third graph shows the time zones of the impressions the advertisements made. This was similar to the second graph although it had more points breaking into different time zones and is more spread out.
